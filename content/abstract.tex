In this dissertation, I demonstrate a comprehensive data center energy and carbon footprint model that consists of four parts. First, I develop a simulator that characterises internet traffic to five internationally dispersed data centers for seven real world internet services. I implement the simulation to indicate the workload demand from each service to each data center. Second, I take the data center wise workloads and construct them with a physics based building energy modeling tool, EnergyPlus, as the coefficients to the IT load profiles that each data center must support every hour of a year. Third, I take the results from the EnergyPlus model and quantify the marginal costs of the energy in terms of Carbon footprint; where the respective regionâ€™s power grid consists of a mix of renewable and carbon based energy sources. Fourth, I couple the marginal energy costs model with a model that quantifies the environmental costs embodied in the materials that the data center is composed of. Through this dissertation I contribute a comprehensive model that quantifies the end to end carbon footprint of global data center systems.
