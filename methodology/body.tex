\chapter{Methodology for Overall Research Strategy}

\section{Chapter Abstract}

This chapter provides the methods used to identify the scope of this dissertation's research around the total costs of ownership of data centers, the methods used for articulating a succinct research question for such a broad and emerging area application, and the the methods used to execute the research. It begins by describing data centers based on past literature to set the context of the research undertaking. Then the chapter discusses the resulting modeling framework from the culmination of the literature reviews and the researcher's professional experiences. The presented model is capable of quantifying the end to end costs of a the global system using life cycle analysis frameworks by demonstrating it effectiveness with the quantification $CO_2$ emissions. 

\section{Introduction}

    This research considers energy and $CO_2$ inventories across the life time of hyper-scale data centers (DC). These DCs house scalable computational architectures consisting of buildings, cooling plants, power distribution systems, compute hardware, digital storage hardware, and network hardware which are the status-quo for internet services. Physically, the size of individual internet DC facilities have increased from modest footprints to now span millions of square feet over the last decade; coinciding with ubiquitous penetration of the internet into the lives of people around the world . The increase in demand for DCs motivates this work as a tool kit in the DC design process. Beyond, the building design process, this kit is intended to be an element for broader business models for internet products.
    
    For internet products, DCs represent a major fraction of their total costs of operations and environmental footprints.  This work develops a modeling framework that couples building energy models, marginal cost of grid energy models, and the embodied costs of materials to provide an end to end assessment of data centers. Specifically, this dissertation demonstrates the models by quantifying the $CO_2$ emissions as a singular metric that is is sufficiently analogous monetary costs.
    
    In the next section, some background and past literature about the sustainability of data centers is presented. These literature guide the development of resulting model from this research by pointing to low hanging fruits and gaps in the current practices. They are the inspiration of the research's methodology. 

\section{Background}

    Data centers (DCs) will consume 13\% of the worlds energy production by 2030 according to worst case prediction models \cite{andrae15}. This high energy demand is not surprising given the ubiquitous penetration of the internet nowadays. For internet DC infrastructure, the energy demand problem space is compounded by a rapid pace of hardware technology innovations on one hand. On the other hand, factoring software technology innovations lead to models that show a brighter picture. This picture is aligned with current trends, where efficiency across the entire DC stack indicates a downward trend for power demand per unit of performance. As an example, by 2016 performance throughput had increased 350\% since 2012, relative to the power demand for computer hardware \cite{GoogleEnvRpt}.  The hardware efficiency gains seen over the last decade still do not offset the need for additional DC physical capacity.
    
    Internet DC capacity is not bound by physical sizes or geographic locations however. Location agnostic networks spanning the globe allow information technology (IT) systems to scale in resource parameters such as CPU, GPU, memory, storage, and data access rates. Parametric scaling of these resources enables operational tuning to compensate for physical capacity constraints. Capacity fungibility of DC parameters at a global scale leads businesses with risky practices to provision building scale data-center infrastructure very lean. While businesses that are adverse to risk can be excessively conservative. In the case of lean provisioning, all physical resources are highly utilized with little or no headroom. For the conservative approaches, normal operating conditions are such that sustained operational points are well below the capacity of the equipment. Operations significantly below capacity allows the service to accept bursts in service, inorganic  growth, and be fault tolerant in case of failures elsewhere in the system. Lean and conservative operations are both classified as equivalent based on today's sustainability indicators.
    
    The prevalent indicator for sustainability of DC facilities is currently the Power Usage Effectiveness metric ($PUE$, see equation \ref{eq:pue}). $PUE$ is a dimensionless ratio of load vs. supply energy.   In the equation $E_{IT}$ indicates the IT energy load and $E_{total}$ indicates the total energy supplied to the facility. The $PUE$ is generally reported in a quarterly or annual basis by integrating the equation across the respective time period. For a given period, the metric measures the operational efficiency of the facility's system compared to the information technology equipment (ITE). Spaces housing ITE have seen profound cooling and power distribution efficiency gains resulting from the focus on $PUE$, however the metric does not comprehensively cover sustainability of DCs.
    
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:pue}
    PUE=\frac{E_{total}}{E_{IT}} 
    \end{equation}
    
    The $PUE$'s shortcomings as a sustainability metric are noted by Horner, particularly that low PUEs do not correlate to low carbon footprint \cite{Horner16a}. The tendency of carbon intensity to vary based on energy source characteristics is demonstrated by Masanet in \cite{Masanet13a}. Masanet shows that energy supply sources must be coupled with lowered demands to be good indicators of use phase carbon footprint. For example, the carbon footprint of a low $PUE$ DC with it's energy sourced from a coal plant will be higher compared to a DC that operates with a slightly higher $PUE$ but sources power from a renewable source. This is summarized in Figure~\ref{masanet13a1}.

    With the proliferation of the PUE as the de-facto efficiency metric, ASHRAE recognized the significance of the cooling systems to the data center energy use. In rapid response they began to develop guidelines to help operators optimize their cooling systems. One of the most profound contribution from ASHRAE has been their position on expanded thermal window for the data center environments. The expanded thermal window has an influence nearly all elements of a data center facility.

    A facility's thermal environment is directly couples the IT and building systems. The first order impacts of this coupling are on the cooling system; spanning from the cooling tower to the node junctions on the nano-scale transistor junctions. The end to end flow of the heat rejection is shown in Figure~\ref{img_dc_infrastructure}.

    However, there are many second order effects that must me taken into account when developing disruptive designs.
    
    
    
    Beyond the operations phase of DCs, the IT hardware and physical infrastructure products they're composed of have many other life-cycle phases. At each life cycle phase of the products there are energy and $CO_2$ inventories. With life cycle analysis (LCA) principles these inventories can be tallied from their raw form to their useful state.  The LCA perspective allows the treatment of these inventories as either a debt or credit to it's environmental footprint. The debt and credit approach follows a structure analogous to total costs of ownership (TCO) methods used in today's sophisticated business models for DCs. These modern business models amortize capital and operating costs over a system's useful life similar to LCA. This research therefore threats $CO_2$ as analogous to monetary cost and demonstrates the end to end $CO_2$ inventories in this dissertation.
    
    The direct effects described so far and discussed throughout this work are the most transparent impacts associated with information communication technology (ICT). The indirect or higher order impacts fundamentally alter the use of energy in a wide breadth of applications. Figure~\ref{ICT_econ} shows examples of the breadth ICT impacts to other industrial sectors. However, this research followed the approach set by The Green Grid where the DC is a physical entity of interest and focuses on the assessment of it's direct life cycle activities \cite{tgg12}. The direct activities are indicated by the red boundary shown in figure  \ref{fig:f2} which sets the boundary conditions described later.

\section{Similar Literature}
    
    Now, pioneering literature to quantify the life cycle costs of DCs is presented. The most explicit DC life cycle costs is by Whitehead \cite{whitehead15}. Whitehead proposes guidelines and criterion for DC life cycle assessments in-line with ISO 14040 \cite{ISO14040}. These ISO standards are the authoritative standard for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) work.  Whitehead's work is based on the LCA of a UK DC with legacy infrastructure. The UK DC is compared to a state of the art DC in Sweden across all phases of their life cycle. The boundary conditions and life cycle phases from Whitehead are shown in figure \ref{LCAphases}. Through sensitivity analysis, Whitehead finds that server stock turnover (refresh) cycles have  the most significant contribution to the embodied impacts in today's state of the art DCs.  Embodied impacts for these DCs dominate the life cycle impacts even more so as the state of the art DCs are optimized for PUE with efficient cooling and power distribution systems . To demonstrate, they performed a comparative evaluation. When quantified, the environmental impacts were double for the Swedish facility. Whitehead attributes this difference to the Swedish data refresh cycle of every 16 months, as opposed to every 36 months for the UK DC. They establish a functional unit of \textit{1 kW of IT per year in a Tier III facility} which is a reasonable units of measure of data centers.

    The Hewlett Packard Corporation published a series of papers around the sustainability of information technology sector in the early 2010's. Two of the most relevant to data centers were led by Shah and Chang \cite{shah11, shah12}. In the first work, Shah demonstrated the use of the economic input-output (EIO) model for assessing the embodied costs of the major infrastructure categories found in data-centers (see Table \ref{shah_components}). Their development of the environmental model for the data center was ultimately a combination of process based and EIO methods. Building on Shahs's EIO based framework, Chang uses the thermodynamic metric of exergy to quantify data center sustainability. By quantifying the irreversible thermodynamic processes in terms of exergy allows normalization in terms of architectural parameters \cite{shah12}. A parametric view enables systems designers to reason about only an intuitive set of constraints.

    In addition to the independent LCA perspective of Whitehead and the corporate perspective of Hewlett Packard, The Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Lab  has produced the CLEER online modeling tool\cite{CLEER13}. CLEER is a web based user interface that allows consumers to model the migration of the CLEER model to assess the life cycle cost of migrating on-premise software workloads to Cloud based data center platforms. As shown in Figure~\ref{img_cleer}, the charter for the CLEER model to consider the end to end energy associated with Cloud services.
